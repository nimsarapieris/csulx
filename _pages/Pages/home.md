## Welcome to the Online Learning Exchange

The Online Learning Exchange has been setup to house a number of resources to support the implementation of the [Online Learning Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/model/) and its enactment within the Transforming Online Learning (TOL) [Learning Experience Framework (LEF)](https://www.csu.edu.au/division/strategic-planning/university-strategy/resources/TOL-LEF_11April2018.pdf). The site provides detailed information about the Online Learning Model itself and expands on the seven elements - Learning Communities, Interaction Between Students, Teacher Presence, Interaction with the Professions, Flexible & Adaptive Learning, Interactive Resources and E-Assessment.

The Online Learning Exchange also houses a comprehensive [list of strategies]({{ site.baseurl }}/strategies/) that provide working examples for implementing the various elements of the Online Learning Model including strategies specifically identified or prioritised for implementation within the TOL LEF.

Finally the [OLM Mixer]({{ site.baseurl }}/model/) provides a tool to help assess current adoption of the model and pathways to improvements and ways of enhancing certain elements within the overall learning design.
