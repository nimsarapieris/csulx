motivation: |-
  PSC102 Botany is a common subject in a number of Bachelor of Agriculture courses and provides a range of resources that, if fully utilised, will help students succeed in the subject. Information and insights on how students actually use the learning resources provided, and what resources students found to be useful is of immense value towards the development of a more personalised learning approach in a core subject.
implementation: |-
  Data analytics has provided helpful insights into how students can be helped to succeed in the subject. Providing more personalised learning content, resources and support, has allowed a more responsive teaching practice and appropriately targeted academic interventions that focus on unengaged students, especially in the first couple weeks of teaching session, or for known problem areas of subject.
